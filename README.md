**This repository includes 6 subfolders: Chicago coyote, Data Processing, JAGS, Makira Fosa2, RNP Fosa, and Simulation Files**
1) The **Chicago coyote** folder includes data, R scripts, and plots specific to case study on coyotes that uses the dynamic MSDOM.
2) The **Data Procesing** folder includes R scripts and example data on how to prepare data for the MSDOM.
3) The **JAGS** folder includes JAGS models for the static and dynamic MSDOM, including the full, reduced, and null parameterizations.
4) The **Makira Fosa2** folder includes fosa data from Makira Natural Park and R scripts for fitting the static MSDOM, including model comparison using CPO.
5) The **RNP Fosa** folder includes fosa data from Ranomafana National Park and R scripts for fitting the MSDOM, including model comparison using CPO.
6) The **Simulation Files** folder includes scripts for simulating data under different versions of the MSDOM (full, reduced, null) and fitting these models using JAGS.
